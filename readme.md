## Number to Words

Problem Statement: Write a program to convert any given number to words.

Advantages:

-   Checking for minus numbers.
-   Checking for empty/null input.

Disadvantages:

-   JavaScript doesn't support numbers greater than 17 digits.
-   Therefore code is not working for numbers greater than 17 digits.

Better Solution:

To overcome the limitation of JavaScript, I've used Python which supports longer numbers.

Advantages:

-   Checks for minus numbers.
-   Checks for empty/null input.
-   Supports any number till maha shankh.

Another Solution:

Advantages:

-   Uses recursion so less code.
-   Supports any number till maha shankh.

Disadvantages:

-   Works only for best case scenario.
-   No checks for minus number.
-   No checks for empty/null input.
