## Number to Words

Problem Statement: Write a program to convert any given number to words.

Features:

-   Checking for minus numbers
-   Checking for empty/null input

Disadvantages:

-   JavaScript doesn't support numbers greater than 17 digits i.e. 999999999999999.
-   Therefore code is not working for numbers greater than 17 digits.

Better Solution:

-   To overcome from the limitation of JavaScript, I've used Python which supports longer numbers.
